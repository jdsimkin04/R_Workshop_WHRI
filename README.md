A short and sweet R basics tutorial for a (bright and enthusiasti) cohort of MPH Students.

Find the R markdown [here](https://github.com/jdsimkin04/R_Workshop_WHRI/blob/master/R_Workshop.Rmd). Covers a short exploratory analysis of Gapminder dataset.

Awesome packages used here:

* Tidyverse
* plotly
* ggthemes
* hrbrthemes 
* kableExtra
* viridisLite

DT did not make it into the rmd but I highly recommend this package for creating data tables.

Have fun with R!
